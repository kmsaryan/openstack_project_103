# OpenStack Cloud Deployment

## Project Overview:
This project aims to automate the deployment and management of services within an OpenStack cloud environment using Ansible and Python scripts.

## Project Goals:
- Automate the deployment of network components, nodes, and services within the OpenStack cloud.
- Implement monitoring and scaling capabilities to ensure efficient resource utilization.
- Provide documentation and guidelines for setting up and managing the deployment solution.

## Technologies Used:
- Ansible
- Python
- OpenStack
- Git

## Standard Operating Procedure:

### install.py:
1. Download the necessary dependencies and packages required for the installation.
2. Execute the installation script using the appropriate command or script execution method.
3. Verify the successful installation by checking for any error messages or logs.

### gen_Config.py:
1. Generate the configuration files required for the deployment of network components, nodes, and services.
2. Ensure that the generated configuration files adhere to the specified standards and requirements.
3. Test the generated configuration files to ensure their correctness and compatibility.

### operate.py:
1. Start and manage the operation of the deployed services within the OpenStack cloud.
2. Monitor the performance and health of the services to ensure their proper functioning.
3. Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the operation and take appropriate actions.

### cleanup.py:
1. Clean up and remove any resources or components that are no longer needed or have become obsolete.
2. Perform necessary checks and validations before removing any resources to avoid unintended consequences.
3. Log the cleanup activities and verify the successful removal of the resources.
